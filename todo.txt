LTO (thin, full)
Save logs and timing

PGO (study the existing 4-stage script)

Check that stage 2 build does not depend on system libstdc++ (it should use libc++).
This can be done with ldd.

Run tests, including libc++ tests.

Uploads to GitHub releases.

Collect some info about headers used when building every C++ file (we should also do this for
other builds as well).

The Final stage install path needs to be:
/opt/yb-build/llvm/llvm-v10.0.1-<suffix>-<timestamp>.
The suffix can also be a timestamp.

Also build iwyu (include-what-you-use) and ASAN/TSAN instrumented libc++.

Double-check compiler output using "nm -gC" and ldd in the compiler wrapper and ensure that
we don't depend on things that we should not depend on.

When using compiler-rt we should not depend on libgcc.a and libgcc_s.so.
